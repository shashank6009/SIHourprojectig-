# Resume Parsing - Fixed and Working!

## ✅ Issues Fixed

1. **PDF Parsing Error**: Fixed the `ENOENT: no such file or directory` error for PDF files
2. **Server-side Processing**: Implemented proper error handling and workarounds
3. **Text Extraction**: Both file upload and text paste now work reliably

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Upload Resume File
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/internship (or whatever port your server is running on)
2. Drag and drop your resume (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) into the upload area
3. The system will automatically extract and fill available fields

### Option 2: Paste Resume Text
1. Click the "Load Sample" button to test with pre-filled data
2. Or paste your own resume text into the text area
3. Click "Process Text & Auto-Fill"

### Option 3: Manual Entry
If automatic parsing doesn't work for your resume format, you can always fill the form manually.

## 📋 Supported Fields

The parser can extract:
- **Personal**: Name, Email, Phone, Address, Date of Birth, Nationality
- **Education**: University, Degree, Graduation Year, CGPA/Percentage
- **Skills**: Technical Skills, Soft Skills, Languages
- **Experience**: Work Experience, Internships, Projects
- **Additional**: Achievements, Certifications, Extracurriculars
- **Preferences**: Career Objective, Preferred Location, Preferred Domain

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### What Was Fixed:
1. **pdf-parse library issue**: The library was looking for a test file that doesn't exist in production. Added a workaround that creates a temporary dummy file when needed.
2. **Error handling**: Better error messages and fallback options
3. **Text processing**: Improved regex patterns for better extraction

### File Support:
- **PDF**: Server-side parsing using pdf-parse (with workaround)
- **DOCX**: Server-side parsing using mammoth
- **TXT**: Direct text processing
- **Maximum file size**: 5MB

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If resume parsing fails:
1. **Check console logs**: Open browser DevTools to see detailed error messages
2. **Try text paste**: Copy your resume text and use the paste option
3. **Format matters**: Ensure your resume has clear section headers (EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, etc.)
4. **Standard formats**: Use standard email/phone formats for better detection

## 📝 Sample Resume

A test resume is available at `/public/test-resume.txt`. Click "Load Sample" to use it.

## 🔄 Server Status

Your development server should be running at:
- Local: http://localhost:3001 (or 3000 if available)
- Check the terminal for the exact URL

The resume parsing feature is now fully functional! 🎉
