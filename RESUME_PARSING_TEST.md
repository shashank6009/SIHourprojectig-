# Resume Parsing Test Instructions

The resume parsing functionality has been fixed and is now ready for testing. Here's how to test it:

## Testing Steps:

### 1. Upload Resume File
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/internship
- Drag and drop a resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) into the upload area
- Or click "Choose File" to browse and select a file
- The system will process the file and auto-fill available fields

### 2. Test with Sample Resume
- Click the "Load Sample" button in the "Paste Resume Text" section
- This will load a pre-formatted test resume
- Click "Process Text & Auto-Fill" to parse and fill the form

### 3. Paste Your Own Resume
- Copy your resume text from any source
- Paste it into the text area under "Alternative: Paste Resume Text"
- Click "Process Text & Auto-Fill"

## What Gets Auto-Filled:

The system can extract and auto-fill the following fields:
- **Personal Information**: Name, Email, Phone, Address, Date of Birth, Nationality
- **Education**: University, Degree, Graduation Year, CGPA
- **Skills**: Technical Skills, Soft Skills, Languages
- **Experience**: Work Experience, Internships, Projects
- **Additional**: Achievements, Certifications, Extracurricular Activities
- **Preferences**: Career Objective, Preferred Location, Preferred Domain

## Important Notes:

1. **File Size**: Maximum 5MB file size is supported
2. **File Types**: PDF, DOCX, and TXT files are supported
3. **Server-Side Processing**: PDF and DOCX files are processed server-side for better reliability
4. **Fallback**: If file upload fails, use the text paste option
5. **Console Logs**: Open browser console to see detailed parsing logs

## Troubleshooting:

If fields are not being filled:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Ensure your resume has clear section headers (e.g., "EDUCATION", "EXPERIENCE", "SKILLS")
3. Make sure email and phone are in standard formats
4. Try the text paste option if file upload doesn't work
5. The parser looks for common patterns - non-standard formats may not be recognized

## Test Resume Location:
A sample test resume is available at: `/public/test-resume.txt`
